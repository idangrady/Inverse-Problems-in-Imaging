This course is about inverse problems in imaging. The mathematical reconstruction and processing of images is of fundamental importance in state of the art applications in health and geosciences, e.g. in medical tomography, in high-resolution microscopy or in geophysical inversion. In many cases, underlying inverse problems can be formulated and solved using variational methods and partial differential equations. This course offers a theoretical as well as an applied insight into inverse problems and variational methods for mathematical imaging. It addresses reconstruction problems of different imaging modalities (e.g. CT or PET) in biomedicine and geophysics. The course covers the full chain of solving inverse problems in imaging, namely

Lecture 1 - What is an inverse problem? In this lecture we give an overview of the course and introduce the basic nomenclature.

Lecture 2 - Discrete inverse problems. In this lecture we treat linear inverse problems in 
. It introduces most of the basic concepts that will be treated in more generality later.

Lecture 3 - Application: Image processing. In this lecture we give an overview of inverse problems arising in various imaging applications like microscopy.

Lecture 4 - Inverse problems in function spaces. Here, we treat the concepts of the previous lectures in a more general setting.

Lecture 5 - A statistical perspective. We revisit the finite-dimensional setting of lecture 2 and introduce a statistical (Bayesian) perspective on inverse problems.

Lecture 6 - Application: Computed Tomography. In this lecture, we treat the tomographic inverse problem, which arises in various applications ranging from electron microscopy to medical imaging.

Lecture 7 - Variational formulations. In this lecture we treat well-posedness and optimality conditions of variational problems arising in inverse problems.

Lecture 8 - Numerical optimisation. In this lecture we discuss various methods for solving variational problems.

Lecture 9 - Application: Wavefield imaging. In this lecture we discuss various inverse problems involving the wave equation.

Lecture 10 - Recent advances. In this final lecture we discuss some recent advances, such as Compressed Sensing or the use of Machine Learning to solve inverse problems.
